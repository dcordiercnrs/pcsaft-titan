The Perturbed-Chain Statistical Associating Fluid Theory (hereafter **PC-SAFT**), equation of state ([Gross and Sadowski, 2001](https://doi.org/10.1021/ie0003887)) which is widely employed in the chemical engineering community. The PC-SAFT has been successfully introduced to the study of Titan by Tan *et al*. (2013, 2015) and Luspay-Kuti *et al*. (2015). The use of PC-SAFT is particularly relevant for the numerical simulation involving liquid-vapor equilibria and/or dissolution in the context of **Titan** (the main moon of the planet Saturn) "**hydrology**" (rain, rivers, lakes and seas of liquid hydrocarbons). This program has been entirely written in `FORTRAN 2008` by [**Daniel Cordier**](http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4515-6271) and its future developments are open to collaboration. The proposed implementation comes as a **`FORTRAN` `module`** which makes easy the reuse of the program and/or its use in a more extended/complex program.

**Two simple demo programs are provided (see below), the first one allows the user to compute the density of mixtures, the second simulates the isotherm binary diagram for a given mixture.**

The PC-SAFT implementation available here has been already use in the following works:

# Quick start with Docker

For those who just want make a very quick test, the best solution is probably to run the programs in a tiny virtual machine which can be set up
using [Docker](https://www.docker.com) (see also the [Wikepedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software))) which can be installed on your
computer by downloading the appropriate version [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) dedicated to your OS.

# How to get the files

There are two options:
- Click on the <font color="#008000">**`Code`**</font> green button (top right of this web page) and download the ZIP archive.
- in a terminal type: `git clone https://github.com/dcordiercnrs/pcsaft-titan.git`

# Requirements

A easy use of the programs  available here requires:
 - a modern `FORTRAN` compiler like [**`gfortran` version 8.3.0**](https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortran)
 - the compilation tool [**`make`**](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
 - **optionally** the versioning tool [**`git`**](https://git-scm.com/)

   - **COMPOUNDS_DATA_PC-SAFT.data**: decribes the properties of the molecules which can be used by the program. The user can add a species just by adding a new line, species can be removed just by deleting lines or by adding a **#** at the beginning of the line.
   - **COMPOUNDS_DATA_PC-SAFT-PARAM_INTERAC.data**: provides the intraction parameters between species.
   - **COMPOUNDS_DATA_PC-SAFT_withASSO.data**: parameters for PC-SAFT version including association terms, not functional for the moment, present just for furture development.

 + **Data files** found in the directory **'DATA_EXPERIMENTAL/'**: experimental measurement to make comparison plots with PC-SAFT outputs.

  - compile the programs with `make`
  - run the program `./pcsaft_demo`
  - read the results in the standard outputs.
  - parameter values can be changed in the source code itself.
  
+ Simulations of a liquid-vapor equilibrium for the binary system N2-CH4 under cryogenic conditions with **binary_N2CH4_demo.f08**:
  - compile the programs with `make`
  - run the program `./binary_N2CH4_demo`
  - results are under the form of two ASCII text files **binary_diag_N2CH4_L.dat** (for the liquid phase) and **binary_diag_N2CH4_v.dat** (for the vapor phase)
  - **Comments**:
    - parameters, like temperature of the system, can be changed in the source code itself.
    - PC-SAFT parameters can be adjusted in data files contained in the directory **DATABASE_PCSAFT/**
    - results produced by this program can be compared to laboratory measurements available under the form of text files in the directory **DATA_EXPERIMENTAL/**

# How to add new species or remove species

To add a new species is relatively simple, a 2 steps procedure has to be followed:
  1. add a new line in the file **`DATABASE_PCSAFT/COMPOUNDS_DATA_PC-SAFT.data`**
  2. add corresponding new lines (more than just one should be required if the user wants to consider the interactions of the added species with many other species, in the file **`DATABASE_PCSAFT/COMPOUNDS_DATA_PC-SAFT-PARAM_INTERAC.data`**

To remove a species (useful only if one wants to test a new set of parameters, the line of standard value is put in comment by writting a "#" at the beginning of the line) needs only to comment the line with a "#"
